					When you import goods, your country’s customs authority may apply
					import duties, VAT/GST, and handling fees. These vary based on the
					product category, declared value, and trade policies. Some shipments
					may be selected for inspection, which could delay delivery or incur
					extra charges.

						Check for trade agreement benefits between your country and India.
