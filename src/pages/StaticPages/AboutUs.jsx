					GemRishi, initially established as a YouTube channel in 2020, by the
					renowned jeweler and gemologist, **Dr. Rishi Verma**, is a culmination
					of passion, expertise, and a profound fascination with the mystical
					properties of gemstones. Popular jewellery company Fateh Chand Bansi
					Lal Jewellers, which started their jewellery business in 1904, also
					sold natural gemstones from the beginning. Later, when the fifth
					generation of Fateh Chand Bansi Lal Jewellers came into business, they
					initiated GemRishi. Dr. Rishi, a fifth-generation jeweler and esteemed
					content creator, was captivated by the enchanting ability of gemstones
					to emit frequencies that harmonize with human energies. The journey of
					GemRishi began with a mission to raise awareness about gems and
					jewelry through engaging and informative YouTube videos. As Dr. Rishi
					shared his wealth of knowledge and expertise, the channel gained
					immense popularity. Thousands of viewers expressed a desire to procure
					genuine and certified gemstones but faced apprehensions about trust
					and authenticity on various platforms.Meet Our Team of Experts
